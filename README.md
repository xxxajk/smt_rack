# smt_rack
Simple work holding rack/carrier for pc boards.

## Instructions
Print everything at 99.99% density zig-zag infill. This allows most slicers to print faster, while giving you a full infill!

For the board racks, print one as-is, and print one mirrored so the bass insert holes can be used.

Print two slide inner rails

Print one each of the remainder.
